39453298,Pulmonary Artery Injury Following Endocardial Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion: The Known and Unknown.,"Oct, 2024","BACKGROUND: Left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) is frequent alternative for stroke prophylaxis in patients for whom oral anticoagulation is contraindicated. Pulmonary artery injury (PAI) is a feared yet rare complication of endocardial LAAC, but its surrounding literature is scarce. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the current study was to review prior PAI published reports and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database to understand evidence and mechanisms of PAI after LAAC. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted of the literature and MAUDE database for previously reported cases of PAI, and cases were reviewed for patient characteristics and outcomes. In addition, we identify risks and review our strategies to avoid this injury. RESULTS: Thirty-six cases (16 case reports and 20 MAUDE reports) of PAI were found. These patients had a mean age of 73.6 ± 8.2 years with a median CHA CONCLUSIONS: Presentation of PAI after LAAC can occur immediately following the procedure or be delayed. Thus, the threshold for suspicion, especially with rapid and hemodynamically significant pericardial effusion, after LAAC should be low.",No Full Text Available

39397352,A comparison of procedure-related adverse events between two right ventricular leadless pacemakers.,"Oct, 2024","INTRODUCTION: The Medtronic Micra VR and Abbott AVEIR VR are the leadless pacemakers (LPM) currently available in the United States (US). Micra VR employs fixation tines and the AVEIR VR uses an active fixation helix. Micra VR requires fixation before electrical measurements are obtained, while R-waves may be mapped by AVEIR VR without fixation. Little comparative data is available for these LPMs. Accordingly, we compared the incidences of procedure-related major adverse clinical events (MACE) and device problems in the US for Micra VR and AVEIR VR during 2022-2024. METHODS: We searched the FDA's Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database for US reports of MACE and device problems that were filed from April 2022 to December 2023 for AVEIR VR, and from June 2022 to April 2024 for Micra VR. Totals for US-registered LPM implants were obtained from the manufacturers' product performance reports. RESULTS: During the study period, 5990 AVEIR VR and 10 940 Micra VR implants were registered in the US. We found 305 MAUDE reports for AVEIR VR (5.1%), versus 541 MAUDE reports for Micra VR (4.9%) (p = .702). The incidence of MACE was 0.72% (43/5990) for AVEIR VR versus 0.59% (65/10 940) for Micra VR, (p = .387). The incidences of procedure-related death, cardiac perforation. cardiac arrest, emergency pericardial drainage or reparative surgery were similar for both LPMs (p > .05). Micra VR had more unacceptable thresholds requiring LPM replacement compared to AVEIR VR (95;0.9% vs. 24;0.4%; p = .001). AVEIR VR had a statistically higher incidence of device dislodgement during (32) and after (21) implant compared to Micra VR (53 (0.9%) vs. 46 (0.4%), p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Micra VR and AVEIR VR have similar procedural safety profiles, including the incidences of death and perforation. However, device problems differed significantly, possibly related to their design differences. Compared to Micra VR, AVEIR VR appears to have an advantageous threshold measurement capability but is more prone to device dislodgement.",No Full Text Available
39368716,Adverse Events of the Over The Scope Endoscopic Clips and Cutters: A MAUDE Database Analysis.,"Oct, 2024","BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The OVESCO® clip system, including the Over-The-Scope Clip (OTSC) and Full-Thickness Resection Device (FTRD), has demonstrated efficacy in managing various gastrointestinal pathologies. However, real-world data on device malfunctions and patient complications are limited. This study aimed to analyze adverse events associated with OVESCO® clips and cutters reported to the FDA Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database. METHODS: The MAUDE database was searched for reports related to OVESCO® clips and cutters from January 1, 2007, to August 30, 2024. Event date, device type and model, manufacturer, event type, device problem, and patient complications were extracted. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the findings. RESULTS: Forty-two reports were identified, with 41 involving OVESCO® clips and one involving an OVESCO® cutter. The most common device problem for OVESCO® clips was failure to deploy (61.0%), followed by unintended deployment or misfiring (17.1%). Gastrointestinal perforation was the most frequently reported patient complication (60%). The OVESCO® cutter report described device component breakage and foreign body retention. No clear trends in adverse event reporting were observed over the study period. CONCLUSION: OVESCO® clips and cutters are associated with potential device malfunctions and patient complications, particularly gastrointestinal perforation. The findings highlight the need for careful patient selection, meticulous technique, and close post-procedural monitoring. Collaborative efforts among stakeholders are essential to optimize device safety and efficacy. Continued post-marketing surveillance and real-world data analysis are crucial for monitoring the performance of endoscopic devices and improving patient outcomes.",No Full Text Available
39353499,Underreporting of complications following AF ablation: Comparison of the manufacturer and user facility device experience FDA database and a voluntary invitation-based registry: The POTTER-AF 3 study.,"Oct, 2024","BACKGROUND: The Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database houses medical device reports of adverse events involving medical devices marketed in the United States submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) by mandatory and voluntary reporters. The MAUDE database is frequently used in clinical studies to report on device-related complications. Data about its efficacy are scarce. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the mandatory MAUDE database (MAUDE group) with the invitation-based POTTER-AF study (POTTER-AF 1 group) regarding data quality, procedural characteristics, diagnosis, treatment, and survival. METHODS: The reports of esophageal fistula esophageal fistula following atrial fibrillation (AF) ablation in the MAUDE database were compared with those in the POTTER-AF study between August 1, 2009, and August 31, 2019. RESULTS: Esophageal fistulas were reported in 47 patients in the MAUDE group and in 81 in the POTTER-AF 1 group. Procedures were performed with radiofrequency, cryoenergy, or laser energy in 66.0%, 31.9%, and 2.1% (MAUDE group) and in 96.3%, 2.5%, and 1.2% (POTTER-AF 1 group). The median time to symptoms was 21 (14, 32.5) days (MAUDE group) and 18.0 (6.8, 22.3) days (POTTER-AF 1 group; P = .031). The diagnostic method was reported in 38.3% of patients in the MAUDE group and in 98.8% in the POTTER-AF 1 group, the treatment in 57.4% and 100%, and the outcome in all patients. In the MAUDE group, treatment was surgical (51.9%), endoscopic (37.0%), combined (3.7%), or conservative (7.4%), compared with 43.2%, 19.8%, 7.4%, and 29.6% in the POTTER-AF 1 group. Overall mortality was 76.6% in the MAUDE group and 61.7% in the POTTER-AF 1 group (P = .118). CONCLUSION: In the mandatory MAUDE database, fewer esophageal fistula cases were reported compared with an invitation-based study. The data quality in the MAUDE database was significantly poorer.",No Full Text Available
39356032,Adverse events related to laser fibers and laser machines during ureteroscopy and stone lithotripsy: Insights from an updated 10-year analysis of the US MAUDE database.,"Oct, 2024","INTRODUCTION: Ureteroscopy has become increasingly chosen as a treatment of choice for patients with kidney stone disease and laser as the energy source for stone lithotripsy is a key part of this. Our aim was to analyse a national database to evaluate the burden of adverse events related to laser fibers and laser machines. METHODS: Search was performed of the Manufacturer User and Facility Device Experience (MAUDE) database in the United States for all events related to holmium laser fibers and holmium laser machines during ureteroscopy between 2012-2021. Information collected included the following: problem, timing, prolonged anaesthesia, early termination of procedure, injury and retained parts. RESULTS: 699 holmium laser fiber events were reported and these had been manufactured by 13 different companies. The commonest problems were breakage outside the patient while in use (26.3%) and breakage of the laser fiber tip (21.2%). Manufacturers concluded root cause to be device failure in 8.9%. 29% of issues occurred before the laser had been activated. 5.2% of cases had to be cancelled as a result of an event. Significantly more injuries were sustained intra-operatively by operating staff compared to patients (6% vs. 0.2%, p < 0.001). All these injuries were superficial burns to the skin with the hand being the most affected body part (88.1%). Zero ocular injuries were reported. Only eight events were related to laser machines and all involved sudden hardware failure but no patient injury. CONCLUSIONS: Laser fibers are fragile. Most adverse events are due to operator error. Direct patient injury from laser fiber is scarce but operating staff should be aware of the risk of sustaining minor burns. Laser machines rarely incur problems and, in this study, did not result in any safety issues beyond need to abort the procedure due to lack of spare equipment.",No Full Text Available
